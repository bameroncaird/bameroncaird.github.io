        <h1>Teaching</h1>
        
        Throughout my junior year of college, I was a TA for various classes in Mizzou's IT department. Some interesting information about this job is that I am not an IT major (I am a CS major) and I never actually took any of the classes that I was a TA for (I had studied the material on my own). Nevertheless, I applied for and got a TA position for the fall in the summer before my junior year started. You will probably wonder why I was a TA for so many classes...there was a group of around 10 TAs who all helped out with multiple classes, so the work all evened out to being reasonable in the end. This page is a summary of all my thoughts about teaching from that experience.
        
        <h4>Fall 2020 Semester</h4>
        
        In fall 2020, I was a TA for the following courses:
        <ul>
            <li>IT1040 - intro programming using python</li>
            <li>IT1600 - "digital systems"</li>
            <li>IT4405 - iOS app dev 1</li>
            <li>IT4425 - iOS app dev 2</li>
        </ul>
        
        Before I talk about the other three, I got assigned to IT1600 because I took and did well in a CS class about digital logic. However, I wasn't assigned to grading for that course and nobody ever came to office hours for it, so there's really nothing to talk about there. In IT1040, I mainly helped students who were learning to program for the first time with basic python coding. For the app dev courses, I helped students learn to make iOS apps.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Basically, I had two jobs as a TA: hold weekly office hours on Discord (sometimes Zoom) and grade for the assigned classes. I will talk about grading at the very end, but this semester I was a grader for both iOS classes. I was also the only TA for IT4425. When I scheduled my office hours in August I decided to do a short session every day, so I would hold office hours for an hour pretty much every day of the week. This was exhausting and I hated having to do it every day, so I did better in the spring. The nutshell is that I love actually helping students with problems but I hate grading and when students try to coax the answers out of me in office hours.
        
        <h4>Spring 2021 Semester</h4>
        In spring 2021, I was a TA for the following courses:
        <ul>
            <li>IT1040</li>
            <li>IT4425</li>
            <li>IT4401 - slightly more advanced python programming than IT1040</li>
        </ul>
        
        IT1040 was about the same as the fall. The students in IT4425 seemed more independent in general this semester and asked me less questions during office hours. I got a few questions in IT4401, but a lot of the students in there were from CS and found python to be easy after learning to program in C as the first course in the curriculum. I will talk more about CS vs. IT a bit later. I was more experienced this semester; calmer in office hours, better at using the Canvas grading system, etc. I also scheduled office hours in 2 3-hour blocks per week instead of every day, which was much better. However, I still messed up by scheduling them on Tuesdays and Wednesdays...I couldn't watch the UEFA Champions League a lot of days because of office hours.

        I want to add some more general thoughts about the experience. I was a TA for a full academic year, and I gained a lot of experience with teaching students. I would say that overall, the pros outweighed the cons and I had a net positive experience. I am not returning to be a TA in the fall because while I am funded for research I am not allowed to work outside of research and internships. Even if I had the option to return, though, I would not because I'm tired of the IT courses. I will explain more about that later.
        
        <h4>The Pros</h4>
        The biggest pro of all is that I learned how much I enjoy teaching. It's nice to explain something in a way that makes someone else understand, and you learn the material better by having to explain it multiple ways. It also improved my patience, not only with other people but with myself; I think that I learned that it's okay if you don't understand something immediately, you just have to keep an open mind and be persistent and eventually you will understand. At the beginning of the year I would get frustrated when students didn't understand what I was saying in office hours, but eventually I realized that I had to be patient and continue explaining the concept in slightly different ways until the student was able to understand. 
        
        <br><br>
        This experience also made me consider a new career path. I like teaching and I think education is really important, so I can definitely see myself being a professor or teacher at some point in my life. I decided that if I want to keep my options as open as possible, it would be good to prepare for being a professor since the qualifications are higher. Most professors have a Ph.D., so I began to think about graduate school. This is part of the reason why I wanted to try research in CS as well. I think I can say that being a TA for my junior year will end up having a big impact on my career.
        
        <br><br>
        I think I became a better student after being a TA for a year. I realized that there were lots of capable students in the class who fell behind because they didn't put in the effort. It made me believe in myself more to see the hard work pay off for some students because I saw firsthand that you get out what you put in. You can control how well you do in a course to some extent with the amount of effort that you're putting in. I also started asking myself while doing my own assignments "if I was a TA for this course, would this answer make sense?" I think this has greatly improved my ability to evaluate myself on my own work.
        
        <br><br>
        I became more sympathetic for professors and TAs. In general, the lesson I learned here in particular is that you will never be able to see how difficult something is without actually doing it. People like to complain about things that they don't work on because they think they could do it better, but in reality it's harder than they think.
        
        <br><br>
        I gained insight about what I would and wouldn't do in a class that I taught. I genuinely feel like, given time to prepare, I could put together a better class on python than IT1040 or IT4401. Although maybe I'm falling victim to my previous point :) Either way, as a graduate student I'm hoping I can teach a class by myself, or at least where I'm the lead instructor. Maybe I could teach a class on deep learning with python, since there's not one available right now. I am very excited for this possibility during my Ph.D.
        
        <h4>The Cons</h4>
        The first con I want to talk about is the grading. Note that this is not a con related to being a TA, it's a con related to the specific course setup in my situation; also, the pandemic was probably a factor in the course setup, and I was only ever a TA during the pandemic. The grading for all of the courses that I was a TA for was based on effort. I was told by the professor in charge of the course that when grading any given assignment, I had two options: 0 or 100. It was very difficult to decide sometimes, and grading was always very subjective. There was a very fine line between being soft and being unfair that I struggled to balance on. I also am of the opinion that effort-based grading is useless. If a student tries and fails, then they still get a perfect grade because they tried. Because they see the perfect grade in Canvas, they will not look at any feedback or revisit the material at all. The little bits of misunderstanding will snowball, and then there are students coming to my office hours for the final project who don't know how to write function definitions in python. I'm sure the professors in charge of the courses would have good arguments in response, but it just doesn't make any sense to me to grade based on effort for every assignment. I also didn't grade the majority of the assignments because there were also quizzes and exams that were automatically graded, but those assignments were extremely easy. For example, the final exam was a quiz in Canvas that was open to students all week. There was no lockdown browser, no time limit, and no restrictions at all. Of course students are going to google the answers and run the questions in a python shell; there is no way of monitoring that behavior, and it makes the assignments trivial. TLDR: the classes were not set up in a way that I think encourages learning.
        
        <br><br>
        The next con I want to talk about is the CS vs. IT thing. As a CS major at Mizzou, I hear a lot of talk about how IT is an easy major compared to CS from the CS people. A possible source of bias in this is that I've seen more CS classes than IT classes. I'm also a CS major...I will not stereotype, but I will give my honest take on the situation. In my experience, most of the IT classes are less rigorous than the CS classes. There are some exceptions; for example, I know for a fact that one of the most important courses, software engineering, is taught much better in the IT department than the CS department because of the professors (I took the CS version). However, if you want to learn to program and be a software engineer or anything programming-related, I think that the CS courses will prepare you better. When I learned to code for the first time it was in CS1050, the equivalent of IT1040 but in C. It was one of the hardest classes I had ever taken, but when I finished I was able to easily learn python. I don't think it would be the same in the reverse case. I think this is also just a fundamental difference in CS vs. IT...usually software developers are more related to CS while networking and cybersecurity people are more related to IT (or something, they're just different). Without saying that CS is better than IT I would say that in general, IT classes are less rigorous. It's a con because people look down on IT within the CS department.
        
        <br><br>
        The last con is almost unavoidable. I think that you can change this to some extent with your course setup, but this will always happen. I just want to complain about it. It's when students came to office hours and asked me questions without even trying to start. I hated the office hour sessions when it was me debugging the student's code. I didn't know where to draw the line and stop giving the students help sometimes. I think in a programming course you have to struggle a little bit to learn. This is something that has to be done on your own. If you struggle and you still can't get it, then you can come to office hours. In a course I was teaching, for example, I would be very vague in office hours and only tell students a handful of information that would not give them the answer at all, but it was difficult because I was not in charge of the course.
        
        <br><br>
        <b>Overall, though</b>: I had a lot of fun and learned a lot by being a TA, and I think I will look back on this someday as the start of my teaching career.
