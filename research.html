        <h1>My Research</h1>
        
        As someone who is pursuing a Ph.D., it would be unusual if I wasn't involved in some sort of academic research. This page offers some information about that.

        <h3>How I Got Involved in Research</h3>
        I have always been interested in being some sort of research scientist. I did my first research in a biology lab in high school. My uncle (<a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/people/mark-watson-md-phd/" target="_blank">Dr. Mark Watson</a>) works in a research lab related to cancer at Wash U in St. Louis (my hometown). In the summer before my senior year (summer 2017), he let me shadow the lab and paid me to be there, which was nice of him because I contributed absolutely nothing to the lab. I was really bored because I wasn't involved in the research, but I learned about the general structure of labs.

        My next research experience was one year later, in the summer of 2018 before my freshman year at Mizzou. I was looking for something to do that summer and at that point I thought I was going to school to study chemistry, so I contacted professors in the chemistry department and asked them if they would take me in their labs. I ended up at <a href="https://www.murr.missouri.edu/" target="_blank">MURR</a>, a research reactor near Mizzou's campus, with <a href="https://chemistry.missouri.edu/people/ferrieri" target="_blank">Dr. Richard Ferrieri</a>. I was bored there as well for some reason, but I think it was because the research was partially in plant biology, something I had no interest in at the time. I had to make a poster presentation and abstract (linked under projects), but I didn't contribute anything to that lab either. When I reflected on this summer, I learned that I should've taken more initiative with my research, because research is largely an independent process.
        
        <br><br>
        After this, I switched my major a lot. At one point I was a chemical engineering major and for a few months I worked in the research lab of <a href="https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/matthias-j-young/" target="_blank">Dr. Matthias Young</a>. I didn't work here for very long and I didn't get to do any actual projects, nor did I understand any of the other projects from the graduate students. I was also having a rough time mentally in that semester so I was really not enjoying the lab. I also didn't think I wanted to have a career related to chemistry anymore and so I quit. I did actually help with something in this lab, though. Matthias, at the time, was a new faculty member at Mizzou. He had just finished a post-doc and was just starting his career as a professor. One of his first tasks was to re-build a piece of equipment that he used at his post-doc called an Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) reactor. His research was related to renewable energy and batteries, and ALD has applications in electronics, water desalination, fuel cells, and more. I helped him out in building the ALD reactor - ordering parts, putting the structure together, etc. One day there was someone in the lab from another lab and Matthias introduced us and told him that I was "crucial" to the building of the ALD reactor...Matthias is a really nice guy. The final product can be seen on the second website linked at the top. After quitting this lab, I took a break from research while I figured out what I wanted to do.

        In the fall of 2020 I knew I wanted to try research in computer science, so I reached out to a professor for a class on databases I was taking at the time, <a href="https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/dan-lin/" target="_blank">Dr. Dan Lin</a>. Dr. Lin accepted me into her cybersecurity lab and after a few months of watching the work presented by the graduate students at our weekly lab meetings, working on small tasks of my own, and being a TA for other classes (which I talk about in the teaching page), I knew I wanted to continue CS research and get my Ph.D.
        <br><br>
        Dr. Lin and I talked about my interest in graduate school, and she helped me apply to a program to fund my Ph.D. The program is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the goal of the program is to fund students interested in cybersecurity to pursue advanced degrees. It's called the Scholarship for Service (SFS), and more information can be found <a href="http://faculty.missouri.edu/lindan/cybercorps/index.html" target="_blank"> here</a>. Dr. Lin is the PI of the program at Mizzou, and since she was the one who told me to apply I knew I had a solid chance at being selected. I was accepted, and I will be using the funding to pursue a Ph.D. with Dr. Lin at Mizzou! I am really excited to start working in the lab in person because so much of my time in college has been spent online because of the pandemic; I feel like I haven't been able to fully experience Mizzou because of everything going online.
        <br><br>
        In the lab, I am working on a project that combines cybersecurity and machine learning for fake voice detection. You can see more details about this under the projects section.

        In the future, I hope to update the formatting on this website so that it's not a wall of black text.
