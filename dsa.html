        <h1>Algorithms & Data Structures</h1>
        
        There are lots of websites out there for learning algorithms and data structures, and I have a little bit of experience with a lot of these websites. Here are some of my accounts:<br>

            <li><a href="https://train.usaco.org/" target="_blank">USACO</a></li>
        </ul>
        I like USACO the best because it gives you a clear path for working through the problems. My current plan is to slowly grind through the USACO problems and then go back to some other websites in the future. Since I am working on research a lot, I don't have much time for these problems, but I will get through them eventually. I am using python for the USACO problems because it's my best language, so I think I can really focus on the algorithm part as opposed to the implementation. Other websites encourage C++ because of the standard library as well as its speed.

        Another way to learn algorithms is by creating simple projects that illustrate their use. <a href="mazes/maze_home.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a simple application of randomized DFS for generation of random mazes that I had fun building.
