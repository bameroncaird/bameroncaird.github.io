        <h1>Converting hex to base 64</h1>
        
        The link to my solution can be found <a href="https://github.com/bameroncaird/cryptopals-solutions/blob/master/second-attempt/set1/hex_to_base64.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
        
        This problem was straightforward, especially because I'm re-implementing it after last year. It says to operate on raw bytes in the challenge page so that was how I got started.
        
        <br><br>
        <b>Step 1</b>: convert the hex string into bytes<br>
        <b>Step 2</b>: convert the bytes into base 64<br>
        <b>Step 3</b>: decode the base64-encoded bytes into a string
        
        <br><br>All three of these steps can be found easily on google and implemented in python.
