        <h1>Algorithms & Data Structures</h1>
        
        I started programming in January of 2019. I had my first algorithms and data structures course in August 2019, and it was the reason I officially switched majors to computer science. There was something so satisfying to me about writing an algorithm that could cover every case and do the same robotic operations in the exact same way every time.
        
        <br><br>
        I have taken more classes on algorithms and data structures since then, but I've done the most productive learning outside of the classroom. I started on a website called <a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">CodeWars</a>, which is where I learned python for the first time. Then, I experimented with C++ on <a href="http://codeforces.com/" target="_blank">CodeForces</a> and learned a bit about competitive programming. I also learned about coding interviews during this time and websites such as HackerRank, LeetCode, etc. 
        
        <br><br>
        All of these websites contain many programming problems related to algorithms and data structures that you can practice on. The best way to learn algorithms and data structures (or so I've heard) is through practice. However, these websites were not really suited for my purpose. It seemed like there were two options - competitive programming or interview prep - which both seemed to focus more on competition and less on learning.
        
        <br><br>
        This summer (summer 2021), though, I decided that I want to really understand algorithms and data structures. Algorithms and data structures, or DSA for short, are the fundamentals of computer science, and I am interested in becoming good with DSA. The best way to do so is by practice; I was looking for a practice website for DSA dedicated to learning. I found <a href="https://train.usaco.org/" target="_blank">USACO</a>. As it says in the introduction, the focus is on "algorithmic programming." Although you can use this website for competitive programming, you can also use it if you just want to learn.
        
        <br><br>
        The other thing I like about USACO is that it gives you a clear path for training. Just solve the problems in order! On other websites there are just too many problems, so you just have to choose yourself. It makes me feel like I'm wasting my time and training inefficiently, so it's nice to have a website that gives you crystal clear material to go from.
        
        <br><br>
        As I go through the material on the USACO website, I will upload my solutions to this website.
