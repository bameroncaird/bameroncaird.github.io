        <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
        Through my research, I've become more familiar with machine learning. Some quick facts about machine learning: machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. My research partially focuses on deep learning for audio, so I've spent a lot of time making random projects and toying around with deep learning models. I decided that I should probably upload some of that stuff to this website and write about it to solidify that information.

        I love machine learning. I would say that it's the "magic" of computer science, which sounds stupid. It's actually just math, but it looks like magic. For example, you can't explicitly give a computer a rule for distinguishing between pictures of dogs and cats, but given the right neural network and lots and lots of examples the computer can get pretty good. And it kind of is magic to us, because one of the problems with neural networks is that they act like black boxes; that is, nobody really knows exactly what patterns a neural network learns to recognize, we just know that a network is able to recognize pattern X with accuracy Y. Either way, it's an exciting field and you can write code in what is in my opinion the best programming language (python), so I'm happy to keep learning about it.

        I was signed up for a course on machine learning through my university in the spring of my sophomore year (before I started doing research in ML), but I ended up dropping it because there was a lot of linear algebra that I didn't know at the time and I was falling behind in the course early on. After taking linear algebra in the next semester and learning machine learning on my own, I realized how heavy on theory the course I dropped was. In graduate school, I would like to teach a machine learning class in python at Mizzou, because I think that's something lacking in the curriculum. I have taken bits and pieces from various online courses and books. Any course by Andrew Ng is usually pretty good, and Francois Chollet's Deep Learning with Python cleared up a lot of confusion for me. Also, the MIT 6.S191 lectures on YouTube are really good, and Valerio Velardo's The Sound of AI channel on YouTube is helpful for deep learning with audio.

        I will document my various ML projects below here!
