        <h1>Fake Voice Detection</h1>
        
        This project combines cybersecurity and machine learning. I hope that my work on this project will eventually result in my first paper. Specifically, a cybersecurity problem is that computers are becoming increasingly good at generating fake voices. In <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402" target="_blank">one example</a>, people were able to swindle lots of money out of a company by mimicking the voice of its CEO using machine learning. Surely, this same technique is applicable in other situations, so we want to limit this problem. 
        <br><br>
        
        From this problem, I have learned a lot about deep learning in particular. I have used python, tensorflow, and keras for developing the related models.

        I started a series of reflections about this project. Hopefully I will have some nice reflections after I finish the project. These are more for me to figure out what I actually know about this project, but if you want to read me ranting about my research you are welcome to. The links can be found here:
