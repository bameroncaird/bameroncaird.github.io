        <h1>Some of my side projects</h1>
        
        <h3>Cryptopals</h3>
        <p>I am extremely interested in cryptography.  Khan Academy has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf9KjCKmDcU&list=PL7AEDF86AABA1AA9A">YouTube series</a> on cryptography, and at the beginning of August 2020 I started to work on the <a href="https://cryptopals.com/">cryptopals problem set.</a> This problem set is a way to gain experience with building and breaking real-world crypto, and I'm really enjoying working on it so far.  My answers to these problems in Python are <a href="https://github.com/bameroncaird/cryptopals-solutions">here</a> on my Github.</p>
        
        <h3>iOS Apps</h3>
        <p>I have enjoyed my computer science classes, but what really got me into programming was iOS app development.  I started teaching myself how to make iPhone apps in the fall of 2019 through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CodeWithChris">YouTube tutorials</a> and I loved seeing my code come to life on a product (the iPhone) that I had used for years.  I have worked on a lot of apps (most of which are useless) but here are a few of my favorites:</p>
        <div id="iosapps">
            <div id="mult" class="app">
                <h4 class="appheader"><a href="https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps/1492601218/appstore/ios/version/deliverable">Multiplication Tables Practice</a></h4>
                <p>This is the first app that I made from start to finish, including submission to the app store.  The app gives users practice with their multiplication tables.  It helped me to solidify my understanding of the basics of iOS development - it's got a colorful UI with a custom font, multiple game modes and screens, a little bit of data persistence with UserDefaults, and a somewhat interesting algorithm that finds nearby answers for the multiple choice section.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="rgb" class="app">
                <h4 class="appheader"><a href="https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps/1493319160/appstore/ios/version/deliverable">RGB Color Match</a></h4>
                <p>This was originally a <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/3715234-swiftui-getting-started">SwiftUI tutorial</a>, but I added some of my own features and it turned out to be a pretty fun game.  You have to match two colors together with red, green, and blue sliders located at the bottom of the screen.  I learned how to lay out my screen with SwiftUI as opposed to Storyboards, and I learned about state variables in SwiftUI.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="pokemon" class="app">
                <h4 class="appheader">Pokemon Team Builder</h4>
                <p>This app is a work in progress, and it combines a lot of what I've learned about app development.  Essentially, it will allow users to build and save Pokemon teams of six.  So far, I have connected my app to Firebase and successfully handled user logins and pulled data from the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">Pokemon API</a>.  The next step is to build a save function so that users can persist the teams they've created after the app closes.</p>

        <h3>Codeforces</h3>
        <p>My favorite computer science courses so far have been related to algorithms and data structures.  Codeforces is a website where you can practice solving algorithm questions and improve your skills in designing algorithms.  My Codeforces profile is <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/trent_alexander_arnold">here</a>.  I have been coding in C++.</p>
