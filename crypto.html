        Cryptography is a very interesting subject. There is a lot of cool history behind it, such as countries using different ciphers to encrypt secret messages. I also think the aspects of code making and code breaking make cryptography inherently interesting.

        Last summer, I found <a href="https://cryptopals.com/" target="_blank">these crypto problems</a> online. As talked about in <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/" target="_blank">this</a> blog post, the problems are good for gaining real-world experience in crypto. I completed set 1 and part of set 2 if memory serves, but then I set it down and stopped working on it for over a year. I recently started to work on the challenges again, and I will be uploading my code and if possible interactive stuff related to the challenges onto this page.

        This summer I really got back into crypto because of the research lab that I work in. We are a cybersecurity lab, and while my current project doesn't have much to do with crypto, there are other projects in the lab that do. This is why I decided to come back to these challenges! I also started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/424170.Code_Breaking" target="_blank">this book</a>, which always encourages me to do more crypto when I sit down to read.

        Cryptography and code breaking have always been interesting to me. I think it would be cool to be a penetration tester, and I'm hoping that the challenges are a good start for potentially finding a job in the future related to pen testing. I also want to understand how cryptography actually works, and I think the challenges will help with that as well. I'm also taking a graduate-level crypto class in the fall of 2021, so I will include information about that on this website; it's another opportunity to further my understanding of crypto.
