        <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
        Through my research, I've become more familiar with machine learning. Some quick facts about machine learning: machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. My research partially focuses on deep learning for audio, so I've spent a lot of time making random projects and toying around with deep learning models.

        I have taken bits and pieces from various online courses and books. Any course by Andrew Ng is usually pretty good, and Francois Chollet's Deep Learning with Python cleared up a lot of confusion for me. Also, the MIT 6.S191 lectures on YouTube are really good, and Valerio Velardo's The Sound of AI channel on YouTube is helpful for deep learning with audio.

        I will document my various ML projects below here!
