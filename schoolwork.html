        <h1>Schoolwork</h1>
        <p>Here are some of the classes I've taken as well as some of the classes I would like to take at Mizzou.  They are organized by department.</p>
        
        <h3 id="cslabel"><a href="http://catalog.missouri.edu/courseofferings/cmp_sc/">Computer Science</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Classes I have taken:
                <ul>
                    <li>CS 1050: Algorithm Design and Programming I (C)</li>
                    <li>CS 2050: Algorithm Design and Programming II (C)</li>
                    <li>CS 3050: Advanced Algorithm Design (C/C++)</li>
                    <li>CS 2270: Introduction to Digital Logic</li>
                    <li>CS 2830: Web Development I</li>
                    <li>CS 3330: Object Oriented Programming (Java)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                My personal favorites:
                <ul>
                    <li>CS 3050 (Advanced Algorithms) has been my favorite CS class so far.  We studied many algorithms and data structures, including heaps, hash tables, trees, and graphs.</li>
                    <li>CS 2830 (Web Development 1) was a class I really enjoyed because we learned so much.  The professor wanted us to learn full-stack web development, so we were taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.  We also learned how to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host websites.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Classes I'm looking forward to:
                <ul>
                    <li>CS 4460: Introduction to Cryptography</li>
                    <li>CS 3280: Computer Organization and Assembly Language</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
