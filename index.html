                I'm a computer science student at the University of Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou). Welcome to my personal website! This website is made from scratch with HTML & CSS.
                <br><br>
                In the fall I will start my senior year as a CS student. I will be dual-enrolled as a senior in the undergraduate program and a first-year in the graduate program. After I finish my B.S., I will pursue my Ph.D.
                <br><br>
                When I'm not doing CS stuff I like to play and watch soccer, chess, and sometimes basketball, hang out with friends and family, ride my bike on trails, read books, play video games, and watch videos on YouTube (usually science, sports, or chess). I've also been getting back into playing the viola, which I played in school orchestras from third grade until senior year of high school.
                <br><br>
                This website is a work in progress...I have days where I work on it from time to time, but I'm usually spending my time on research so the updates are sparse.
