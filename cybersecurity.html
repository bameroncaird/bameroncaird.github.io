        <h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
        
        <h3>Research Lab & GenCyber</h3>
        As I talked about in the <a href="" target="_blank">research page</a>, I work on cybersecurity issues in a cybersecurity lab with funding from a cybersecurity program, so cybersecurity is an interest of mine. I talk more about my actual research in the link I just gave, but another cybersecurity-related thing I've done is a camp for K-12 teachers to help them better educate young kids on cybersecurity issues. More information about the camp can be found <a href="https://engineering.missouri.edu/2021/07/missouri-teachers-to-learn-cyber-skills-at-gencyber-camp/" target="_blank">here</a>. I learned a lot by preparing for the camp, as I had to learn some of the fundamentals of cybersecurity such as these <a href="https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/intro_to_first_principles/README/" target="_blank">first principles</a>. At the end of the camp the teachers made lesson plans for their students based on what they learned during the week, and I thought it was interesting and important to see how cybersecurity is being taught to students in 2021.
        
        <h3>Crypto</h3>
        Cryptography is a very interesting subject. There is a lot of cool history behind it, such as countries using different ciphers to encrypt secret messages. I also think the aspects of code making and code breaking make cryptography inherently interesting.

        Last summer, I found <a href="https://cryptopals.com/" target="_blank">these crypto problems</a> online. As talked about in <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/" target="_blank">this</a> blog post, the problems are good for gaining real-world experience in crypto. I completed set 1 and part of set 2 if memory serves, but then I set it down and stopped working on it for over a year. I recently started to work on the challenges again, and I will be uploading my code and if possible interactive stuff related to the challenges onto this page.
        
        <br><br>
        This summer I really got back into crypto because of the research lab that I work in. We are a cybersecurity lab, and while my current project doesn't have much to do with crypto, there are other projects in the lab that do. This is why I decided to come back to these challenges! I also started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/424170.Code_Breaking" target="_blank">this book</a>, which always encourages me to do more crypto when I sit down to read.
        
        <br><br>
        Cryptography and code breaking have always been interesting to me. I want to understand how cryptography actually works, and I think the challenges will help with that. I'm also taking a graduate-level crypto class in the fall of 2021, so I will include information about that on this website; it's another opportunity to further my understanding of crypto.

        <a href="https://github.com/bameroncaird/cryptopals" target="_blank">Here</a> is a GitHub repository with all my solutions to the challenges.
