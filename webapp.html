        <h1>Web and Mobile App Development</h1>
        I will put my experiences with web and mobile app development on this page, as I have done a bit of both.
        
        <h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
        I taught myself to make mobile apps. I started with Xcode and Swift, but as I gained more knowledge I also learned to make Android apps with Android Studio and Java as well as cross-platform apps that could be developed for both iOS and Android at the same time with Flutter and Dart.
        
        <br><br>
        Eventually, I also got involved with a mobile app development group on campus. This group was put together by the <a href="https://missouri.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/mizzou-computing-association" target="_blank">Mizzou Computing Association (MCA)</a>. I joined in the winter of 2020, right before the pandemic hit, and once that happened the group fizzled out before we got to build anything together.
        
        <br><br>
        After this, I became a TA for two iOS app development courses through Mizzou's IT department. More information for this can be found on my home page under the teaching tab.
        
        <br><br>
        All of this resulted in many apps. There were two that ended up on Apple's app store:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/bameroncaird/Multiplication-Tables" target="_blank">Multiplication Tables</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/bameroncaird/RGB-Color-Match" target="_blank">RGB Colors</a></li>
        </ul>
        Note that they are no longer up because I cancelled my Apple Developer membership.
        
        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        I first learned web development from a class at Mizzou, and you are looking at some of the stuff I learned right now! I also worked as a web developer for the <a href="https://career.missouri.edu/" target="_blank">MU Career Center</a>. The Career Center website is a Wordpress website so there were a lot of very easy tasks, but at times I had to write code to help out. Below are two links to scripts I wrote for various tasks I did at the career center. If you want to find more info, you can view the ReadMe files in the repositories.
