        <h1>Web and App Development</h1>
        I will put my experiences with web and app development on this page, as I have done a bit of both.
        
        <h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
        I taught myself to make mobile apps.

        Eventually, I also got involved with a mobile app development group on campus. This group was put together by the <a href="https://missouri.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/mizzou-computing-association" target="_blank">Mizzou Computing Association (MCA)</a>. I joined in the winter of 2020, right before the pandemic hit, and once that happened the group fizzled out before we got to build anything together.

        After this, I became a TA for two iOS app development courses through Mizzou's IT department. More information for this can be found on my home page under the teaching tab.
